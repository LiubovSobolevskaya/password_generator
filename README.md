# Password Generator
3rd hallenge of the UCB Bootcamp 

_______________________

If you need a new password that is secure, click a button to generate one. You will need to choose a length between 8 and 128 characters, and decide whether or not to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. At least one character type must be selected. Once you have answered all the prompts, the input will be validated. Finally, a password will be generated based on the selected criteria and either displayed on the page.

## Disclaimer

For the list of special characters I refered to [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_special_characters_for_passwords). For this reason, space is included to the list of special charaters.
